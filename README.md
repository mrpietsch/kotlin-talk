# An opinionated introduction to Kotlin

This is an introduction to Kotlin which I gave to colleages in a workshop on Dec 7th, 2018.

It contains the `/slides` as well as some code snippets used during the presentation in the `/codes` directory.

## Credits

Among others my presentation was inspired by https://fabiomsr.github.io/from-java-to-kotlin/ and also uses some snippets from there. Also it references the very good cheat sheet (http://jussi.hallila.com/Kollections/) by Jussi Hallila (https://github.com/Xantier).
